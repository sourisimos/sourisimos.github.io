More and more studies are raising the alarm about the importance of interpretability in artificial intelligence. The possibility of reasoning and discrimination biases restricts the use of machine learning in critical fields such as aviation or healthcare, where learned models must be transparent. 
Despite the growing number of research groups on the subject, no study to date has succeeded in designing an inference algorithm that provides satisfactory transparency on its decision-making. 
This internship investigated a promising avenue: mixed-weight neuro-fuzzy networks. These are inference algorithms combining neural networks and fuzzy logic. The integration of fuzzy logic and the design of adaptable rules involve the use of Boolean weights on certain layers of the network, while the other network parameters are continuous variables. Learning this hybrid network is therefore based on mixed-variable optimization. 
This internship led to the design of a learning algorithm incorporating an adapted Tabou search and classical backpropagation. In addition, a method for translating the different network weights after learning was presented and studied. The results obtained at the end of this internship provide partial answers to the many questions posed by this problem, and offer promising prospects for the future.
