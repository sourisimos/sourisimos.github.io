The field of Neuro-Fuzzy systems represents a key intersection between neural networks and fuzzy logic, addressing the critical need for transparency in inference processes. While neural networks excel in tasks such as classification and regression, their "black-box" nature often limits interpretability, especially in applications requiring high assurance and verifiability. Neuro-fuzzy networks offer a solution by combining the adaptive learning capabilities of neural models with the interpretability of fuzzy logic. This presentation delves into the evolution of these systems, exploring various architectures, training algorithms, and techniques for fuzzification and defuzzification. The goal is to enhance the transparency and reliability of neuro-fuzzy systems, with a particular focus on their application in contexts where both accuracy and interpretability are paramount. By fostering collaboration across disciplines, this research aims to advance the theoretical and practical development of neuro-fuzzy approaches, providing valuable insights for future work in machine learning and statistical inference.
