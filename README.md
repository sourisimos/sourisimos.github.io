Hi! :)

I’m an engineering student at INSA Toulouse, specializing in Applied Mathematics with a focus on Machine Learning and Deep Learning.<br>
Over the years, I’ve developed a deep passion for the transformative potential of deep learning to drive positive change in the world. I’m eager to continue exploring this field and to apply its powerful techniques to tackle real-world challenges and ensure the best use of it. <br>
To this purpose, I’m committed to exploring diverse applications of deep learning, always seeking to expand my skills and knowledge. <br>
Outside of my studies, I love inventing and working on a variety of projects. To me, machine learning and deep learning are powerful creative toolkits that help bring my ideas to life.

If you’re interested in collaborating or have ideas to discuss, feel free to reach out via email. I’d love to connect!
