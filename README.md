Hi, my name is Thomas Sesmat. I am a student engineer at INSA Toulouse (Institut National des Sciences Appliqu√©es), majoring in Applied Mathematics. Over the years, I have specialized in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

My research interest mainly focuses on developing more robust and interpretable deep learning algorithms.

Outside of my studies, I love inventing all kinds of things and enjoy working on multiple projects. I naturally like to leverage machine learning and deep learning to bring these projects to life.
