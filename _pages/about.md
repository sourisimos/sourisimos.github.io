Hi! :)

Iâ€™m an engineering student at INSA Toulouse, specializing in Applied Mathematics with a focus on Machine Learning and Deep Learning.<br>
Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed a deep passion for the transformative potential of deep learning to drive positive change in the world. Iâ€™m eager to continue exploring this field and to apply its powerful techniques to tackle real-world challenges and ensure the best use of it. <br>
To this purpose, Iâ€™m committed to exploring diverse applications of deep learning, always seeking to expand my skills and knowledge. <br>
Outside of my studies, I love inventing and working on a variety of projects. To me, machine learning and deep learning are powerful creative toolkits that help bring my ideas to life.

If youâ€™re interested in collaborating or have ideas to discuss, feel free to reach out via email. Iâ€™d love to connect!
