Hi, my name is Thomas Sesmat. I am a student engineer at [INSA Toulouse](https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/ "INSA Toulouse"), majoring in Applied Mathematics. Over the years, I have specialized in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
My research interest mainly focuses on developing more robust and interpretable deep learning algorithms. 
Outside of my studies, I love inventing all kinds of things and enjoy working on multiple projects. I naturally like to leverage machine learning and deep learning to bring these projects to life.

If you are interested in collaborating or have ideas to share, please email me!
